## Project: Python Homework - PyBank and PyPoll

## Description:
This project was created to demonstrate a number Python scripting concepts on test data sets of financial records data (PyBank) and local election data (PyPoll). Concepts covered include: importing/reading .csv files, storing data in variables, creating and modifying lists and dictionaries, iterating through data sets, writing to output files, etc.

## Notes:
Each exercise contains its own set of folders for:
- Analysis (the final .txt output of the repective script),
- Final Code (the respective final .py script file), and
- Resources (the respective data set operated on).

## **Important Usage Notes:**
The script files reference the respective data files in Resources as a relative path.
